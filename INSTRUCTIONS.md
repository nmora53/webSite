# Welcome to Electric Owl Carnival 2020! 🎡

First, make sure you've read the [**event overview**](https://wiki.hq.twilio.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=SALESENG&title=20Q4+-+Electric+Owl+Carnival) in the wiki, and that you've joined the `#se-electric-owl-carnival-2020` Slack channel.

This is template repository, the starting point from which your team will submit the code from your project.

⚠️ All submission repos are required to be generated from this template. The technical assesment portion of the final global round will be based solely on the contents and links from your team's repo.

## How to Use This Template

Only one team member must complete these steps:

1. Click on the green "Use this template" button.
2. Choose a repo name, and switch the owner to be "salesengineering".
3. Choose a visiblity level. You may make your repo private, but you will be asked to switch it to public during judging.
4. Once your new repo is created, be sure to invite your team members as collaborators with write access by going to _Settings_ > _Collaborators & teams_ > and inviting teammates using their GitHub usernames.

### Hacking an IoT Project?

If your team is submitting an IoT project, please also make sure to:

1. Commit both the `agent.nut` and `device.nut` files to your repo
2. On impCentral, invite `jhall`, `staxerman`, and `gcosme` as collaborators with the "Developer" role to your Electric Imp project.

More details relating to Electric Imp will be giving during the IoT workshop on Day 1.

## Getting Ready for Submission

**All project submissions must be submitted by 6:00 AM your local time on Demo Day, Thursday October 22nd.**

Before you submit your repo, please make sure to:

1. Fill out your README.md with a description of your project. We encourage you to briefly describe the value and novelty of your idea, who the target audience is, any caveats, and how you would expand upon your submission given more time.

2. Remove any superfluous files from your repo.

3. If not already, make your repository public.

4. Add @jhall, @staxerman, and @gcosme as collaborators to your repo as part of technical judging.

**Good luck and happy hacking! 🦉**
